ML Code for Uni Drone Project
So far, I have an unfinished version of the spatial CNN, I need to add Thermal detection capabilities, and I actually need to add the KAIST and LLVIP datasets, other than that, this should be fine thus far.


Shabd: Streamlined ML to run off of GPU, added python files to do so, added database, weights after training found in spatial_person_detector_full.pth
